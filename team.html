                  <a href="#" title=""> </a>
                  <p>MUN is very special to Lojain; through it, she discovered her passion for law and arguing with people, which led her to co-founding the MUN club at her high school. A big part of MUN is discussing world problems that must be solved; such as the Uyghur genocide crisis in East Turkestan. Being an Uyghur herself, that crisis is very near and dear to her heart; which is why she values advocacy and education about such topics over anything. Now Lojain is a senior law student at Prince Sultan University with a deep passion for international law and art.

                    debating, and Jessup. Nora’s peaked curiosity about the environment, international law, and politics
                    led her to studying law in PSU, and oftentimes spends her time reading books and sketching.</p>

                    Learning), she knew this was her opportunity to shine since PBL combines public speaking,
                    campaigning, and most relevantly graphic design. Over the years, Yara learned about 3D
                    printing, robotics, and programming through a variety of courses and workshops, consequently
                    she always knew she wanted to study Software Engineering, which is exactly where she is now.
                    When it comes to hobbies, she enjoys drawing, swimming, and watching movies, especially
                    science fiction including Star Wars movies.
